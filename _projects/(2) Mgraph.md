# Algorithm Library and Visual System for Anomalous Subgraph Detection

The library embraces five popular algorithms that are widely used in anomalous subgraph detection within the concept of data mining. For big data processing, we parallelize most of algorithms and deploy them in Spark. The visual system helps analysis and selection of best-matched algorithms for different datasets. The project is open source in [[Github]](https://github.com/fjzzhongyi/Mgraph).
